			<p>I'm a third year student at the Universit√© de Bordeaux, in France, and studying Computer Sciences</p>
			I'm interested in computers since I tried to make my own video game when I was younger.
			I discovered about theorical computer sciences during my studies at the University and took fond of it.
			The subjects of Linguistics and Compilers are my favorites.
			<p>Aside from theorical domains, I like coding some tools or small games, and C# is currently my favorite programming language.</p>
